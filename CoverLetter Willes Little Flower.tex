Dear Sir,\\[.5em]

I am writing to express my interest in your school as junior section teacher. I am recently completed my bachelor's degree in business administration from Heriot Watt University, UK. Now I would like to pursue my career in teaching profession where I can continue to learn something new. I possess the necessary classroom management skills and enthusiasm to be able to become the key member of your team. My education and teaching assistance internship will enable me to leverage my capabilities and produce the best results.

I have been working as a house tutor for more than 5 years and most of my students are from English medium. As a teacher, my main goal is to motivate students to do their best and extend their own personal limits. I devise programs, according to syllabus requirements, that expand on previous knowledge and encourage students to explore new and interesting possibilities. I encourage students to construct their own learning in an environment that stimulates and helps students to realise their full potential. I have had some excellent results with students who have a history of poor performance. I strive to instil a love of learning and to make learning exciting and interesting. One student who had difficulties with English is now reading aloud with confidence and is enjoying reading for pleasure.

Moreover, I was involved in an international retail company as a retail sales operative, where I gained success in managing fundamental administrative tasks for that company of over hundred employees. Working closely with manager from different departments allowed me to analyze and interpret department's needs giving me the ability to make wise managerial decisions on my own and those diverse experiences have opened my ability to adjust quickly changing environment. Furthermore, I was working with St. Merry's Youth Organization as a general secretary, through my work experience I have developed strong organizational and time management skills which would be very beneficial for your facility.

I am extremely interested to join your team as a junior section teacher and confident that my experience and skills will be an asset to your students' learning and development and would love the opportunity to work at your school. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
