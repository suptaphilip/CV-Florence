Dear Sir,\\[.5em]

I am writing to express my interest in your school as junior section teacher. I am recently completed my Bachelor's degree in business administration from Heriot Watt University, UK. Now I like to pursue my career in teaching profession where I can continue to learn and grow my abilities as well as at the same time applying those in the position that will allow me to make a valuable contribution to your organization.

My academic background has provided me with a strong understanding of administration principles and practice which are complemented by any exceptional abilities to apply any knowledge and training to real world situations. Moreover, I was involved in an international retail company as a retail sales operative, where I gained success in managing fundamental administrative tasks for that company of over hundred employees. Working closely with manager from different departments allowed me to analyze and interpret department's needs giving me the ability to make wise managerial decisions on my own and those diverse experiences have opened my ability to adjust quickly changing environment.

Furthermore, I was working with St. Merry's Youth Organization as a general secretary, through my work experience I have developed strong organizational and time management skills which would be very beneficial for your facility. Particularly, I am highly effective in welcoming and directing customers; scheduling appointments, answering and forwarding telephone calls, compiling and typing email and correspondence, arranging educational and cultural programs.In addition, I am well versed in photocopying and distributing materials, setting up and maintaining office filing system as well as record keeping. My enclosed resume will provide with more details of my qualifications.

I am extremely interested to join your team as a administrative assistant. I firmly believe, you will find my skills and values appropriate to your requirements. Also I am positive that my contribution to your organization will prove to be lasting if you will give me opportunity. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
